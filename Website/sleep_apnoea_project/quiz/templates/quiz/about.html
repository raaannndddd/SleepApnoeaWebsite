    <h1>About Swillow</h1>
    <p>
      One billion people worldwide are diagnosed with sleep apnoea [1], yet over 80% of these cases remain undiagnosed [2]. Sleep apnoea lowers the blood oxygen levels at night, contributing to organ damage and is known to cause heart and brain conditions [3]. The consequences of sleep apnoea, such as accidents and increased morbidity, have widespread economic impacts, accounting for billions of dollars annually in healthcare resources [4]. Current diagnostic practices are costly, physically invasive and inconvenient to access [5]. There is a limited awareness of sleep apnoea and its severity, and the stigma attached to the diagnosis and treatment process has created an overall negative perception. Patients' overall safety and quality of life depend on the treatment of sleep apnoea; to achieve this, accessing diagnosis is crucial. 
    </p>
    <p>This leads us to our solution... SWILLOW</p>
    <p>
      SWILLOW is a smart pillowcase containing a sensor-equipped device that records snoring and breathing patterns - no wires and no discomfort. Access our website for a quick questionnaire and to receive your personalised risk score. SWILLOW will let you know whether it's time to see your GP. Non-invasive. Accurate. Easy. The Swillow smart system is built from an OZN-15E analogue microphone, a 7-V battery and ESP32 microcontroller. The microphone will allow the microcontroller to extract features from the sleep data to be sent using wifi to the website. The microcontroller will take into account snore pitch, volume, frequency and duration, as well as other apnoea events such as long pauses in breathing. The data features will be analysed using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM, or Logistic Regression, which are trained on normal sleep data. The website will also contain a symptom questionnaire, which will collect further data to be processed by the ML algorithms. These algorithms will return a probability of apnoea risk score from the questionnaire and sleep data. The user may be advised to investigate further, and their sleep data can later be sent to a GP.  The questionnaire and users' probability score can also be shared on social media to help raise awareness for sleep apnoea.
